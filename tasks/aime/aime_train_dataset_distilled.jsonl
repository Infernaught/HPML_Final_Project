For this minimum $M$ , what is $100M$ ?","answer":"<think>\nWe need integer A_i summing to 19 while minimizing the maximum error M = max_i |A_i \u2013 a_i|.  Since all a_i are in (2.5,3), the only reasonable integer approximations are 2 or 3.  If exactly k of the A_i are 3 and the rest 2, the sum is 2(7\u2013k)+3k =14+k, so to get 19 we need k=5 (five 3\u2019s and two 2\u2019s).\n\nFor any choice of two indices to round down to 2 and the others to 3, M is the larger of\n  \u2013 the worst \u201cdown\u2010round\u201d error a_i\u20132 among the two chosen, and\n  \u2013 the worst \u201cup\u2010round\u201d error 3\u2013a_i among the other five.\n\nWe tabulate a_i\u20132 for i=1,2,\u2026,7:\n  i=1:2.56\u20132=0.56\n  i=2:2.61\u20132=0.61\n  i=3:2.65\u20132=0.65\n  \u2026\n  i=7:2.86\u20132=0.86\n\nAnd 3\u2013a_i:\n  i=1:3\u20132.56=0.44\n  i=2:0.39\n  i=3:0.35\n  \u2026\n  i=7:0.14\n\nTo minimize M we should choose as the two \u201c2\u2019s\u201d the a_i with the two smallest down\u2010errors.  Those are i=1 (error 0.56) and i=2 (error 0.61).  Then the maximum down\u2010error is 0.61, and among the other five the worst up\u2010error is 3\u20132.65=0.35 (at i=3).  Hence M = max(0.61,\u20090.35) = 0.61.\n\nTo see M cannot be smaller: if M<0.61 then a_2 cannot be rounded to 2 (since 2.61\u20132=0.61> M), nor can any of a_3,\u2026,a_7 be (those all have a_i\u20132 \u22650.65).  Only a_1 could be 2, giving at most one \u201c2\u201d and sum \u22641\u00b72+6\u00b73=20 but we need exactly two 2\u2019s to hit sum=19.  Thus M\u22650.61, and 0.61 is achievable.\n\nTherefore 100M = 61.\n<\/think>\n<answer>61<\/answer>"}

{"prompt":"In an office at various times during the day, the boss gives the secretary a letter to type, each time putting the letter on top of the pile in the secretary's in-box. When there is time, the secretary takes the top letter off the pile and types it. There are nine letters to be typed during the day, and the boss delivers them in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. While leaving for lunch, the secretary tells a colleague that letter 8 has already been typed, but says nothing else about the morning's typing. The colleague wonders which of the nine letters remain to be typed after lunch and in what order they will be typed. Based upon the above information, how many such after-lunch typing orders are possible? (That there are no letters left to be typed is one of the possibilities.)","answer":"<think>\nModel the situation as a stack\u2010permutation problem.  Letters 1\u20139 are pushed in order; to type a letter is to pop it whenever it reaches the top.\n\nWe know letter\u00a08 has been popped by lunch, and at the moment of popping 8 the stack contains exactly those letters <\u00a08 that have been pushed but not yet popped.  Call that set T\u2286{1,\u2026,7}.  Moreover, because pushes are in increasing order, the stack (from bottom to top) is the increasing sequence of the elements of T.  Any further pre\u2010lunch pops simply remove the largest remaining elements of T in descending order.  Thus at lunch the set of untyped letters from {1,\u2026,7} is some U\u2286{1,\u2026,7}, and they sit on the stack in increasing order.\n\nLetter\u00a09 cannot sit on the stack at the moment 8 is popped (if it had been pushed already it would have to be popped before 8), so at lunch 9 is not yet on the stack.  Thus 9 will be typed after lunch exactly in those scenarios where it has not already been delivered\u00a0&\u00a0typed before 8, i.e. exactly when 9\u2209\u201calready typed\u201d at lunch.\n\nHence the letters remaining to be typed after lunch are\n  \u2013 the subset U\u2286{1,\u2026,7} still on the stack (stacked in increasing order), and\n  \u2013 possibly letter\u00a09 (if it has not yet been typed).\n\nWe count the distinct possible pop\u2010orders x of those remaining letters.\n\nCase\u00a01: 9 was already typed before lunch.  Then the only operations after lunch are pops from the initial stack U (in descending order, since no smaller\u2010letter pushes remain).  Hence for each U the after\u2010lunch sequence is forced to be the strictly decreasing listing of U.  There are \u2211_{k=0}^7 C(7,k)=2^7=128 such sequences (including the empty sequence when U=\u2205).\n\nCase\u00a02: 9 still to be typed.  Then after lunch we have: initial stack U (increasing bottom\u2192top), then at some point a push(9), then its pop, interleaved with pops of U.  But since the pushed 9 must sit atop the stack as soon as it arrives, one can pop from U only before push(9), and after push(9) one must pop 9 before touching the old stack.  Thus the pop\u2010order x has the form\n\n  (suffix of U popped before 9), then 9, then (remaining of U popped)\n\nand in each of the two blocks the U\u2010elements come off in descending order.  If |U|=m, choosing how many of them to pop before 9 is choosing an index i with 0\u2264i\u2264m, giving m+1 possibilities per U.  Hence the total number of sequences in this case is\n\n  \u2211_{m=0}^7 [C(7,m)\u00b7(m+1)]\n= \u2211_{m=0}^7 m\u00b7C(7,m)  +  \u2211_{m=0}^7 C(7,m)\n= 7\u00b72^6  +  2^7\n= 448 + 128\n= 576.\n\nAdding both cases gives 128+576 = 704 distinct possible after\u2010lunch typing orders.\n<\/think>\n<answer>704<\/answer>"}

{"prompt":"A stack of $2000$ cards is labelled with the integers from $1$ to $2000,$ with different integers on different cards. The cards in the stack are not in numerical order. The top card is removed from the stack and placed on the table, and the next card is moved to the bottom of the stack. The new top card is removed from the stack and placed on the table, to the right of the card already there, and the next card in the stack is moved to the bottom of the stack. The process - placing the top card to the right of the cards already on the table and moving the next card in the stack to the bottom of the stack - is repeated until all cards are on the table. It is found that, reading from left to right, the labels on the cards are now in ascending order: $1,2,3,\\ldots,1999,2000.$ In the original stack of cards, how many cards were above the card labeled $1999$ ?","answer":"Here is a concise solution without revealing every private step:\n\nOutline of solution:\n\n1.
