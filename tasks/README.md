This subdirectory contains the `scripts` subdirectory, as well as subdirectories for each task.
- `scripts` contains the scripts used to obtain certain datasets, etc. These scripts should be run from the base repository (i.e., `python tasks/scripts/get_aime_dataset.py`).
- Each task directory (such as `aime`) contains a `{task}_train_dataset.jsonl`, a `{task}_eval_dataset.jsonl`, and a `reward_functions.py`.
