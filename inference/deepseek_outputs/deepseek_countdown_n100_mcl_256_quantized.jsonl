We have the numbers [96, 76, 76].\n2. The sum of these numbers is 248, which is greater than 95.\n3. Therefore, we need to subtract numbers to get the sum to 95.\n4. We cannot use the same number twice, so we'll need to use 76 once and 96 once.\n5. To get the sum 95 with 76 and 96, we need to subtract 76 from 96.\n6.
