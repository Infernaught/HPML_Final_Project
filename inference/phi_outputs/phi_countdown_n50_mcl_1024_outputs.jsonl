Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>First, I'll consider the possible combinations of the given numbers that can lead to 50 using basic arithmetic operations.<\/think>\n\nHere are a few possible combinations:\n\n1. (74 - 15) * (9 \/ 9) = 50\n2. (74 * 9) - (15 + 9) = 50\n3. (74 * (9 - 15)) \/ 9 = 50\n\nI'll now check which combination actually results in 50:\n\n1. (74 - 15) * (9 \/ 9) = 59 * 1 = 59 (This is not equal to 50)\n2. (74 * 9) - (15 + 9) = 666 - 24 = 642 (This is not equal to 50)\n3. (74 * (9 - 15)) \/ 9 = 74 * (-6) \/ 9 = -444 \/ 9 = -49.333... (This is not equal to 50)\n\nNone of the above combinations produce the desired result. Let me try another approach:\n\n<think>Let's try to find a combination where I can use each number once, and the result is 50. I'll start by adding and subtracting the numbers and then adjusting the results with multiplication or division.<\/think>\n\n1. (74 + 9) - 15 = 83 - 15 = 68\n2. (74 - 9) * 15 = 65 * 15 = 975\n\nI'm getting close, but neither of these results in 50. Let's try another approach:\n\n<think>What if I combine these numbers differently, using multiplication or division after adding or subtracting them?:\n\n1. (74 + 9) - 15 = 83 - 15 = 68\n2. (74 + 15) - 9 = 89 - 9 = 80\n\nThese results are close to 50, but not quite there. Let's try to involve division or multiplication to get closer to 50:\n\n1.

(74 - 9) * 15 \/ 9 = 65 * 15 \/ 9 = 975 \/ 9 = 108.33 (This is not equal to 50)\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. (74 * (9 - 15)) \/ 15 = 74 * (-6) \/ 15 = -444 \/ 15 = -29.6 (This is not equal to 50)\n\nI seem to have made an error in my calculations. I'll re-evaluate the numbers:\n\n1. (74 * (9 - 15)) \/ 15 = (74 * (-6)) \/ 15 = -444 \/ 15 = -29.6 (This is negative, not equal to 50)\n\nI apologize for the confusion. Let me try again, considering that one of the operations might be wrong or that I might need to group the numbers differently.\n\n<think>After reconsidering the options, I see that I can adjust the division to get closer to 50:<\/think>\n\n1. (74 * (9 - 15)) \/ (9 \/ 5) = (74 * (-6)) \/ 1.8 = -444 \/ 1.8 \u2248 -246.67 (This is negative, not equal to 50)\n\nI'm not getting the desired result yet. Let me try a different combination:\n\n<think>What if I multiply the difference between the two smaller numbers with the largest number and then divide by the remaining number?:\n\n(74 -","inference_time":43.1491463184}

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nFirst, I'll look for a combination of operations that will give me 61 when I use the given numbers. I'll start by trying different operations:\n\n1. Addition: 22 + 32 + 53 + 46 = 153 (too high)\nSo, I'll try subtraction or multiplication.\n\n2. Subtraction: I can try subtracting one number from another to get closer to 61.\n\n3. Multiplication: I can try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n\nLet's try multiplying 22 and 32, and then subtracting 53 and adding 46:\n\n(22 * 32) - 53 + 46\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n\n(22 * 32) = 704\n704 - 53 = 651\n651 + 46 = 697 (too high)\n\nThis didn't work.

I need to adjust the numbers to get closer to 61.\n\nLet's try dividing one of the numbers by another and then add or subtract the rest:\n\n(53 \/ 22) + 32 - 46\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n\n(53 \/ 22) \u2248 2.409 (rounded to three decimal places)\n2.409 + 32 \u2248 34.409\n34.409 - 46 \u2248 -11.591 (negative, too low)\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n(53 + 46) - (22 * 32) \/ 53\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n\n(53 + 46) = 99\n(22 * 32) = 704\n704 \/ 53 \u2248 13.301 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\n99 - 13.301 \u2248 85.699\n\nThis is still too high. I need to adjust the numbers further.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n(53 - 46) * (32 \/ (22 + 32))\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n\n(53 - 46) = 7\n(32 \/ (22 + 32)) = 32 \/ 54 \u2248 0.593 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\n7 * 0.593 \u2248 4.151\n\nThis is still too low. I need to find a better combination.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, I found the following equation that equals 61:\n\n(53 - 22) * 46 \/ 32\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n\n(53 - 22) = 31\n31 * 46 = 1426\n1426 \/ 32 \u2248 44.5625 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nThis is still not 61.

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nFirst, I will look for a combination of operations that could give me a number close to 35 using the given numbers.\n\nOne possible approach is to try to get a sum close to 35 and then adjust it using multiplication or division.\n\nLet's see if we can create a sum close to 35:\n65 + 21 = 86 (too high)\n84 + 71 = 155 (too high)\n\nNow, let's try to subtract one of the numbers from another and see if we can get closer to 35:\n84 - 21 = 63 (still too high)\n71 - 65 = 6 (we need to add something to get closer to 35)\n\nNow, I can combine these results with addition or subtraction to get closer to 35:\n63 + 6 = 69 (still too high)\n\nLet's try a different approach. We can try to use multiplication and division:\n\n65 * 71 = 4615 (too high)\n84 \/ 21 = 4 (we can use this result in combination with other operations)\n\nNow, let's see if we can combine these results with addition or subtraction:\n\n4615 - 84 = 4531 (still too high)\n4 + 65 = 69 (still too high)\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n65 + (84 \/ 21) = 65 + 4 = 69 (still too high)\n(84 - 65) \/ (71 \/ 21) = 19 \/ (71 \/ 21)\n\nNow, we need to simplify the division and see if we can get closer to 35:\n\n19 \/ (71 \/ 21) = 19 * (21 \/ 71)\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n19 * (21 \/ 71) = 409 \/ 71\n\nNow, we need to find a way to adjust this result to get closer to 35. Since 409 is much larger than 35, we need to find a way to reduce it. We can use the remaining number, 71, to adjust the result:\n\n409 \/ 71 - 71 = (409 - 71 * 71) \/ 71\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n409 - 71 * 71 = 409 - 5041 = -4632\n\nNow, we have:\n\n-4632 \/ 71\n\nThis division will result in a negative number, which is not what we want. We need to rethink our approach and find a different combination of operations that can lead us to 35.\n\nLet's try using multiplication and division again, but this time, let's combine all operations in a different way:\n\n(84 \/ 21) * (65 - 71) = 4 * (-6)\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n4 * (-6) = -24\n\nThis result is still not 35.

Since I have to use each number once, I'll look for operations that can help me get close to 29.\n\nOne possible approach is to multiply two numbers and add or subtract another number. For example, if I multiply 28 and 1, I get 28.
