Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nFirst, I will consider the operations and how they can be combined to get the result.\n\n1. If I divide 74 by 2, I get 37. Now I have 15, 37, and 9.\n2. I can subtract 9 from 37 to get 28.\n3. Now, I have 15 and 28. I can add 15 to 28 to get 43.\n4. Finally, I can subtract 3 from 43 to get 40, and then add 10 to reach 50.\n\nTo reach the number 10, I can divide 74 by 7.4, but this would not give me a whole number.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n1.

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nFirst, I'll analyze the given numbers: 54, 47, and 79. I need to find a way to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, \/) to get a result of 86.\n\nTo get a reasonable combination, I'll start by looking for potential pairs that can be added or subtracted to get closer to 86.\n\nOne possible pair is 54 and 47, as their sum is 101. However, that's too large on its own. I could try subtracting 79 from 101 to get closer:\n\n54 + 47 - 79\n\nNow, let's calculate the result:\n\n101 - 79 = 22\n\n22 is far from 86. I need to find a way to increase this result. Since I haven't used multiplication or division yet, I can try multiplying one of the numbers by a small whole number and see if it gets me closer to 86.\n\nIf I multiply 47 by 2, I get:\n\n47 * 2 = 94\n\nNow I can add this to my previous result:\n\n22 + 94 = 116\n\nThis is too high. But if I subtract 79 from 94 instead, I might get closer:\n\n94 - 79 = 15\n\nNow I can add this result to 22:\n\n22 + 15 = 37\n\n37 is still quite far from 86. Let's see if there's another way to combine these numbers.\n\nLet's try subtracting 79 from 54 first:\n\n54 - 79 = -25\n\nNow, let's add 47 to the result:\n\n-25 + 47 = 22\n\nThis is the same result as before, so it's not working. I need to find a different approach.\n\nLet's try using division and multiplication in a different order. If I multiply 47 by a fraction, I might get closer to 86.\n\n47 * (1\/2) = 23.5\n\nNow, let's add this result to 54 and subtract 79:\n\n54 + 23.5 - 79\n\nNow, let's calculate the result:\n\n54 + 23.5 = 77.5\n77.5 - 79 = -1.5\n\nThis is still not close enough to 86. I've tried multiple combinations, but none of them seem to work.\n\nAfter reviewing my attempts, I realize that I might have made a mistake in my calculations. Let me re-evaluate my approach.\n\nI see that I can multiply 47 by 2 and then divide the result by 2 to get the original number back:\n\n47 * 2 \/ 2 = 47\n\nNow let's use this result in a different combination. If I subtract 79 from 54 and then add the result of 47 * 2 \/ 2:\n\n54 - 79 + 47 * 2 \/ 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the result:\n\n-25 + 47 = 22\n\n22 + 22 = 44\n\n44 is still far from 86. It seems that there might not be a straightforward solution using these numbers and the given operations. I will re-check my approach to ensure I'm not missing any possible combinations.\n\nAfter re-evaluating, I have realized that I can use the following equation:\n\n(54 - 79) + (47 - (-79))\n\nLet's calculate the result:\n\n-25 + (47 + 79)\n\n-25 + 126 = 101\n\nNow, I can divide 101 by 1.05 (approximately 0.05) to get 86:\n\n101 \/ 0.05 = 86\n\nSo, the final equation is:\n\n(54 - 79) + (47 - (-79)) \/ 0.05\n\n<answer> (54 - 79) + (47 - (-79)) \/ 0.05 <\/answer>\n\nPlease note that 0.05 is","inference_time":41.7239153385}

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nTo create an equation that equals 72 using the numbers 81, 80, and 71, we can start by considering the differences between these numbers that can help us get closer to 72.\n\nWe have:\n81 - 71 = 10\n80 - 71 = 9\n\nWe can use these differences to set up the equation. Since we know that 72 is close to 71, we can try to add or subtract a multiple of one of the differences to\/from 71 to get 72.\n\nLet's try 71 + 9:\n71 + 9 = 80\n\nNow, we need to use the number 81 to our advantage. We can achieve this by multiplying the result by a fraction that will bring it closer to 72.\n\nSo, we can multiply 80 by the fraction (81\/80):\n80 * (81\/80) = 81\n\nNow, we need to subtract this result from our initial 71 to get 72:\n71 - 81 = -10\n\nBut we need a positive 72, so let's try to adjust the equation. We can subtract the difference between 81 and 80 (which is 1) from 81:\n\n81 - (81 - 80) = 81 - 1 = 80\n\nNow, we can multiply this result by the fraction (71\/80) instead of (81\/80):\n\n80 * (71\/80) = 72\n\nSo, the final equation is:\n<answer> (80 * (71\/80)) - 1 <\/answer>\n\nTo verify this:\n(80 * (71\/80)) - 1 = (71) - 1 = 70\n\nThis doesn't give us the correct answer. Let's reconsider our approach.\n\nWe can use division and subtraction to get closer to 72:\n\n(81 \/ (80 - 71)) + 71 = (81 \/ 9) + 71 = 9 + 71 = 80\n\nNow, we need to subtract 8 to get 72:\n\n80 - 8 = 72\n\nTo incorporate all three numbers, we can use parentheses to adjust the order of operations:\n\n<answer> (81 \/ (80 - 71)) - 8 <\/answer>\n\nTo verify this:\n(81 \/ (80 - 71)) - 8 = (81 \/ 9) - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1\n\nThis still doesn't give us the correct answer. Let's try a different approach:\n\nWe can use multiplication and division to get closer to 72:\n\n(81 \/ 80) * 71 = (0.99875) * 71 = 70.95875\n\nNow, we need to add a small number to get 72. Since we have not used the number 71 yet, we can add the difference between 71 and the result we just obtained:\n\n70.95875 + (71 - 70.95875) = 70.95875 + 0.04125 = 71.00\n\nThis is still not 72, but we're close.

Let's try one more approach:\n\nWe can use division, subtraction, and parentheses to get 72:\n\n(81 \/ (80 - (71 \/ 71))) = (81 \/ (80 - 1)) = (81 \/ 79) \u2248 1.038\n\n","inference_time":41.7780508995}

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>First, I need to find a way to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 38. I can start by trying to divide one of the larger numbers by a smaller one to get a number close to 38. I notice that 95 divided by 76 gives me a value close to 1.25, which is not close enough. So, I will try to find another combination.<\/think>\n\n<think>Next, I can try combining 36 and 90 using multiplication or division to see if I can get a number close to 38. Multiplying 36 and 90 gives me 3240, which is too high. However, dividing 90 by 36 gives me 2.5, which is too low.

Adding 76 to 2.5 gives me 78, which is too high. But if I subtract 76 from 2.5, I get -73.5, which is still too low. This means I need to find a way to adjust the multiplication or division between 36 and 90 to get a higher result when combined with 76.<\/think>\n\n<think>I can try to divide 90 by 36 and then multiply the result by 76. Dividing 90 by 36 gives me 2.5, and multiplying 2.5 by 76 gives me 190, which is still too high. However, if I divide 90 by 36 and then multiply by 76 and subtract 95, I might get the desired result.<\/think>\n\n<think>Now, let's calculate the equation: (90 \/ 36) * 76 - 95. This simplifies to (2.5 * 76) - 95 = 190 - 95 = 95, which is still too high. I need to find a way to decrease this value.\n\n<think>Instead of subtracting 95, let's try subtracting (95 \/ 2) from the previous result.

This will give us: (90 \/ 36) * 76 - 76 = (2.5 * 76) - 76 = 190 - 76 = 114, which is too high.\n\n<think>Finally, I notice that if I multiply 36 by (90 \/ 76) and then subtract 95, I might get the desired result.

This simplifies to 42.63 - 95 = -52.37, which is still too low.\n\n<think>After trying various combinations, I realize that I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me try multiplying 36 by (90 \/ 76) and then dividing the result by 2: 36 * (90 \/ 76) \/ 2 = (36 * 90) \/ (76 * 2) = 3240 \/ 152 = 21.25.\n\n<think>Now, let's add 95 to this result to get 38: 21.25 + 95 = 116.25, which is still too high.
