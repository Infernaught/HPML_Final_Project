We need to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, \/) and parentheses to get the result of 50.\n\nAn approach could be to first try to get close to 50 by combining two numbers, and then adjust with the third number.\n\nFirst, let's consider multiplying 15 and 9:\n15 * 9 = 135\n\nNow we need to get closer to 50 by subtracting or adding a number. Since 135 is much larger than 50, we need to subtract a number.\n\nWe can try subtracting 74 from 135:\n135 - 74 = 61\n\nNow we have a number (61) that is too large. We need to find a way to decrease it by using 9, but simply subtracting 9 won't get us to 50.\n\nSo, let's try dividing the result by 9 instead:\n61 \/ 9 \u2248 6.78\n\nWe are still not close to 50, and we have used all the numbers. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try adding 15 and 9 first, and then divide by 74:\n(15 + 9) \/ 74\n\nNow let's calculate that:\n24 \/ 74 \u2248 0.324\n\nThis is still not close enough to 50. Since we have already tried dividing, let's try subtracting 9 from 15 and then multiplying by 74:\n(15 - 9) * 74\n\nNow let's calculate that:\n6 * 74 = 444\n\nThis is much larger than 50. We need to find a way to divide or subtract to get closer to 50.\n\nLet's try dividing 74 by 9 and then adding 15:\n(74 \/ 9) + 15\n\nNow let's calculate that:\n8.22 + 15 \u2248 23.22\n\nThis is still not close enough to 50. Let's try another approach.\n\nLet's try multiplying 15 by 9 and then subtract 74:\n(15 * 9) - 74\n\nNow let's calculate that:\n135 - 74 = 61\n\nThis is still too large. We need to find a way to use the number 9 to adjust this result.\n\nLet's try adding 9 to the result we got earlier:\n61 + 9 = 70\n\nThis is still too large. We need to find a way to divide or subtract to get closer to 50.\n\nLet's try subtracting 7 from 74 and then adding 15:\n15 + (74 - 7)\n\nNow let's calculate that:\n15 + 67 = 82\n\nThis is still too large. We need to find a way to divide or subtract to get closer to 50.\n\nLet's try dividing 74 by 9 and then subtracting the result from 15:\n15 - (74 \/ 9)\n\nNow let's calculate that:\n15 - 8.22 \u2248 6.78\n\nThis is still not close enough to 50. It seems we need to try a different combination.\n\nLet's try adding 15 and 9 first, and then multiplying by 74:\n(15 + 9) * 74\n\nNow let's calculate that:\n24 * 74 = 1776\n\nThis is much larger than 50, and we have already tried this combination.\n\nAfter trying various combinations, it seems challenging to create an equation that equals exactly 50 using these numbers.

Let's try dividing by 2 instead:\n\n24 \/ 2 = 12\n\nNow, I'll add this to 25:\n\n25 + 12 = 37\n\nNow I'm too low, which means I need to increase the result by subtracting a smaller number.
