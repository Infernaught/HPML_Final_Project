The sum of the items is 30:\n   a + b + c + d + e = 30\n\n2. The mode of the list is 9, meaning that 9 appears at least twice in the list:\n   Since 9 is the mode, we can assume the list looks like [9, 9, x, y, z] for some distinct positive integers x, y, and z.\n\n3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. Since the list is sorted in ascending order, the median is c. Therefore, c must be a positive integer that is not in the list.\n\nNow, we can use these assumptions to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\na + b + c + d + e = 30\n9 + 9 + c + x + y = 30\n18 + c + x + y = 30\nc + x + y = 12\n\nSince c is not in the list, and it must be less than 9 (otherwise, 9 would not be the mode), the maximum value for c is 8.\n\nLet's try c = 8:\n8 + x + y = 12\nx + y = 4\n\nSince x and y must be distinct positive integers, the only possible values for x and y are (1, 3) or (2, 2).

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think> \nStep 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF, where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. We have three triangles formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The side lengths of these triangles are 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the side length of the hexagon.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the triangle formed by the extensions\nSince the hexagon is equilateral and all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF form three triangles that are similar to each other and to the hexagon.\n\nLet x be the side length of the hexagon. Then, we have the following proportions:\n\n200\/x = 240\/x = 300\/x\n\nStep 3: Solve for x\nSince all sides are proportional, we can choose any pair and solve for x:\n\n200\/x = 240\/x\nCross-multiplying:\n200 * x = 240 * x\n\nStep 4: Simplify and solve for x\nSince both sides are equal, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n200 * x = 240 * x\n\nDividing both sides by x:\n\n200 = 240\n\nThis equation is not true, which means there must be an error in our assumption that the sides are proportional. Instead, let's consider the ratio of the extensions to the side length of the hexagon:\n\n(200 + x)\/x = (240 + x)\/x = (300 + x)\/x\n\nStep 5: Solve for x using the first ratio\n(200 + x)\/x = (240 + x)\/x\nCross-multiplying:\n200x = 240x + x^2\n\nStep 6: Rearrange the equation and solve for x\nx^2 - 40x = 0\nx(x - 40) = 0\n\nSince x cannot be 0 (as it represents the side length of the hexagon), we have:\n\nx - 40 = 0\nx = 40\n\nSo the side length of the hexagon is 40.\n\n<answer> 40 <\/answer>","inference_time":21.867980957}

We can find the largest number divisible by 7 by dividing 9999 by 7 and taking the floor of the result:\n\n9999 \u00f7 7 = 1428 (rounded down)\n\nNow, we multiply this quotient by 7 to find the largest four-digit number divisible by 7:\n\n1428 * 7 = 9996\n\nSo, 9996 is the largest four-digit number divisible by 7.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest number N that satisfies the given condition. We can do this by changing one digit of 9996 to 1. We'll start from the left and check each digit:\n\n9996 -> 1999 (not divisible by 7)\n9996 -> 9199 (not divisible by 7)\n9996 -> 9919 (not divisible by 7)\n9996 -> 9991 (not divisible by 7)\n9996 -> 9991 (not divisible by 7)\n9996 -> 9996 (divisible by 7)\n\nWe found that changing the last digit to 1 gives us a number (9996) that is divisible by 7.\n\nNow, we need to find Q and R, the quotient and remainder when N (9996) is divided by 1000:\n\n9996 \u00f7 1000 = 9 with a remainder of 960\n\nSo, Q = 9 and R = 960.\n\nFinally, we find Q + R:\n\n9 + 960 = 969\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer> 969 <\/answer>.","inference_time":20.0047652721}

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nFirst, we need to find the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is tangent to the sphere internally ($r_i$) and externally ($r_o$).\n\nWhen the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the radius of the circle of tangency is the difference between the radius of the sphere and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus (which is the sum of the radius of the torus and the radius of the circle).\n\nLet R be the radius of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6 + R.\nSo, we have:\nr_i = 11 - (6 + R)\n\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the radius of the circle of tangency is the sum of the radius of the sphere and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus (which is the radius of the torus minus the distance from the center of the torus to the circle).\n\nSo, we have:\nr_o = 11 + (6 - R)\n\nNow, we need to find R. The radius of the torus is the distance from the center of the circle (which is the same as the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus) to the point where the circle touches the torus. Since the circle has a radius of 3, and it is in the plane of the torus, the distance from the center of the torus to the circle is 3.\n\nSo, we have:\nR = 6 + 3 = 9\n\nNow we can find $r_i$ and $r_o$:\n\n$r_i = 11 - (6 + 9) = -4$\n$r_o = 11 + (6 - 9) = 8$\n\nBut since $r_i$ is negative, it means that the torus doesn't actually touch the sphere internally. So, we only have $r_o$.\n\nNow, we can find $r_i - r_o$:\n\n$r_i - r_o = -4 - 8 = -12$\n\nSince we want the absolute difference, we take the absolute value:\n\n$|r_i - r_o| = 12$\n\nAnd the fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$ becomes $\\frac{12}{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer> 12 + 1 = 13 <\/answer>.","inference_time":24.1832532883}

The incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. The incenter is also the center of the incircle, which has a radius of 6 (inradius).\n\nNext, recall that the distance from the incenter to the circumcenter (IA) is equal to the difference between the circumradius (R) and the inradius (r). This can be written as:\nIA = R - r\n\nWe are given that IA = 13 - 6 = 7.\n\nNow, let's use the properties of the triangle to solve for AB * AC.\n\nWe know that the area (K) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\nK = (AB * AC) \/ 2\n\nWe also know that the area can be calculated using the inradius (r) and the semiperimeter (s) of the triangle:\nK = r * s\n\nSince we have two expressions for the area, we can set them equal to each other:\n(AB * AC) \/ 2 = r * s\n\nNext, let's express the semiperimeter (s) in terms of the circumradius (R) and the inradius (r). The semiperimeter can be expressed as:\ns = R + r\n\nNow, substitute the values of R and r into the equation:\ns = 13 + 6 = 19\n\nNow, replace s in the equation for the area:\n(AB * AC) \/ 2 = 6 * 19\n\nSimplify and solve for AB * AC:\n(AB * AC) = 2 * 6 * 19 = 228\n\nSo, the product of AB and AC is:\n<answer> 228 <\/answer>","inference_time":16.7601883411}

However, this problem may be computationally intensive to solve directly. Instead, let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the maximum value of the product a*b, b*c, and c*a. Since a + b + c = 300, the maximum value occurs when two variables are equal and the third is 150.

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think> First, we need to understand the properties of 13th roots of unity. Since $\\omega$ is a 13th root of unity, we have $\\omega^{13} = 1$. Also, for any integer $n$, $\\omega^{13n} = (\\omega^{13})^n = 1^n = 1$.\n\nNow, let's rewrite the given product:\n\\[\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\\omega^k+\\omega^{2k})\\]\n\nWe can group the terms with even and odd powers of $\\omega$ separately:\n\\[\\left(\\prod_{k=0}^{6}(2-2\\omega^k)\\right) \\left(\\prod_{k=0}^{6}(\\omega^k+1)\\right)\\]\n\nLet's analyze the first product, $\\prod_{k=0}^{6}(2-2\\omega^k)$.\n\n<think> Notice that for each term in the product, there is a corresponding term with the same power of $\\omega$ but with opposite sign. For example, $\\omega^0$ and $\\omega^6$ are such terms. When we multiply them, we get $2\\omega^0 - 2\\omega^6 = 2 - 2\\omega^6$, which is a difference of two terms where each term contains an even power of $\\omega$.\n\nThis means that the product of all such pairs will cancel out, leaving us with only the constant term, which is $2^7 = 128$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second product, $\\prod_{k=0}^{6}(\\omega^k+1)$.\n\n<think> For $\\omega^0$, we have $1+1=2$. For $\\omega^1$, we have $\\omega+1$. For $\\omega^2$, we have $\\omega^2+1$. For $\\omega^3$, we have $\\omega^3+1$. For $\\omega^4$, we have $\\omega^4+1$. For $\\omega^5$, we have $\\omega^5+1$.

Let's re-evaluate our reasoning.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, I realize that I made an error in my reasoning.

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think> First, let's consider the dodecagon and its internal structure. A regular dodecagon has 12 sides and 12 vertices. To form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines. Since all sides of the dodecagon are equal, we can draw lines connecting non-adjacent vertices to form parallel lines.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel lines.\n\n1. We can choose two sets of parallel lines by selecting one vertex and another vertex that is 4 vertices away (since 12\/2 = 6, and we want pairs that are parallel). There are 12 vertices, and we need to choose 2 of them, so there are C(12,2) = 66 ways to choose these vertices.\n\n2. However, some of these pairs of vertices will form lines that are not parallel. For example, if we choose vertices 1 and 5, the lines connecting them will not be parallel to any of the other lines. To avoid this, we need to consider only those vertices that are separated by a multiple of 3 vertices (since 12\/3 = 4). This gives us 4 pairs of vertices that can form parallel lines.\n\n3. Now, for each of these 4 pairs of vertices, we can form 2 rectangles by choosing one line from each pair. Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 4 * 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n<answer> 8 <\/answer>","inference_time":13.50629282}
