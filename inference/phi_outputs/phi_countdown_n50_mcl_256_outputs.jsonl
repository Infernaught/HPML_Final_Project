Since 77 is the largest number, we can try subtracting a portion of it to get closer to 62.\n\nWe know that 77 - 54 = 23, which is closer to 62 than 77 itself. Now we need to find a way to get from 23 to 62 using the remaining numbers 69 and 54.\n\nIf we add 69 to 23, we get 92, which is too high. However, if we subtract 54 from 92, we get 38, which is still too high.\n\nSo let's try another approach. We can combine the numbers differently:\n\n77 - 54 = 23\n23 + 69 = 92\n\nNow we need to find a way to decrease 92 to 62. We can do this by subtracting 54 (which we haven't used yet) from 92:\n\n92 - 54 = 38\n\nNow we have 38, which is still too high. We can try subtracting a smaller number from 69 to make it closer to 38:\n\n69 - 30 = 39\n\nNow we can subtract 39 from 38 to get closer to 62:\n\n38 - 39 = -1\n\nThis doesn't work as we are getting a negative result. Let's try a different approach:\n\n77 - 54 = 23\n23 + (69 \/ 3) = 23 + 23 = 46\n\nNow we need to find a way to increase 46 to 62. We can do this by adding the remaining number 54:\n\n46 + 54 = 100\n\nThis is too high. Let's try dividing 69 instead of multiplying by 3:\n\n77 - 54 = 23\n23 + (69 \/ 2) = 23 + 34.5\n\nNow we need to get rid of the decimal part (0.5) using 54. We can subtract 0.5 from 54 by dividing it by 2:\n\n54 - (54 \/ 2) = 54 - 27 = 27\n\nNow we can add 27 to 23 + 34.5:\n\n23 + 34.5 + 27 = 84.5\n\nWe are still too high, so let's try a different combination:\n\n77 - 54 = 23\n23 + (69 \/ 3) = 46\n46 + (54 \/ 2) = 46 + 27 = 73\n\nNow we need to decrease 73 to 62. We can do this by subtracting 11:\n\n73 - 11 = 62\n\nTo get 11, we can subtract 1 from 69 and then divide by 6:\n\n(69 - 1) \/ 6 = 68 \/ 6 = 11\n\nNow we can put it all together:\n\n<answer> (77 - 54) + ((69 - 1) \/ 6) = 23 + 11 = 34<\/answer>\n\nHowever, this still doesn't give us the desired result of 62.

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>First, we need to find a combination of operations that will give us 75 using the numbers 2, 84, and 33. We can start by trying to subtract a smaller number from a larger one to get closer to 75.\n\nIf we subtract 2 from 84, we get 82, which is still quite far from 75. Let's try using the third number, 33, to get closer to our target.\n\nIf we subtract 33 from 82, we get 49. Now we are closer to 75, but we still need to add 26 to reach 75.\n\nWe can achieve this by multiplying 33 by a fraction that will give us the remaining 26 when added to 49.\n\nLet's find the fraction.

I notice that if I add 71 and 13, I get 84, which is close to 54. However, using these two numbers directly will overshoot the target. So, I need to find a way to reduce 84 to 54.\n\nOne possible approach is to subtract 30 from 84, which would give me 54 exactly. To create the subtraction of 30 using the given numbers, I can multiply 14 by 2 and then subtract 13 from the result.\n\nLet's write this down:\n(14 * 2) - 13 = 28 - 13 = 15\n\nNow, I need to somehow get from 15 to 30 using the remaining number, which is 44. It's not possible to reach exactly 30 by multiplying or dividing 44 with any other number.

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nFirst, we need to find a way to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get the result of 38.\n\nWe can start by trying to subtract a smaller number from a larger number to get closer to the target value.\n\nLet's consider using the largest number, 95, and subtract a smaller number from it. If we subtract 59 (95 - 36), we get 36.\n\nNow we need to add or multiply\/divide to get closer to 38. Let's try adding 2 to 36.\n\nSo the equation becomes: (95 - 36) + 2\n\nLet's calculate it:\n\n<think> (95 - 36) = 59\n59 + 2 = 61\n<\/think>\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't give us the desired result of 38. We need to try a different combination.\n\nLet's try using the remaining numbers, 90 and 76, with the number 36 we already used.\n\nIf we subtract 76 from 90, we get 14. Then we can add 36 to 14:\n\n(90 - 76) + 36\n\nCalculating it:\n\n<think> (90 - 76) = 14\n14 + 36 = 50\n<\/think>\n\nThis is also not the desired result. Let's try another approach.\n\nWe can multiply two numbers and then subtract the third number:\n\n(95 * 76) - 36\n\nCalculating it:\n\n<think> (95 * 76) = 7220\n7220 - 36 = 7184\n<\/think>\n\nThis is still not the desired result. We need to try a different combination.\n\nLet's try using the remaining number, 90, and divide it by the smaller number, 36:\n\n(90 \/ 36) + 95\n\nCalculating it:\n\n<think> (90 \/ 36) \u2248 2.5\n2.5 + 95 = 97.5\n<\/think>\n\nThis is not the desired result either. We need to consider another approach.\n\nLet's try using the remaining numbers, 90 and 76, and subtract the smaller number from the larger one, then divide by 36 and add 95:\n\n((90 - 76) \/ 36) + 95\n\nCalculating it:\n\n<think> (90 - 76) = 14\n14 \/ 36 \u2248 0.389\n0.389 + 95 \u2248 95.389\n<\/think>\n\nThis is not the desired result. Let's try another approach.\n\nWe can try using division and multiplication in a different way:\n\n(95 \/ (90 \/ 76)) - 36\n\nCalculating it:\n\n<think> (90 \/ 76) \u2248 1.184\n95 \/ 1.184 \u2248 80.098\n80.098 - 36 \u2248 44.098\n<\/think>\n\nThis is still not the desired result.
