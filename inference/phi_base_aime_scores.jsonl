So, R = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nNext, let's find the radius of the circle where the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, which we'll call r_i. The distance between the center of the torus and the center of the sphere is the difference between the sphere's radius (11) and the torus's radius (9), which is 2.

To do this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is 2, and the difference between the torus's radius (R) and the sphere's radius (11) is 11 - 9 = 2. So, r_o can be found as follows:\n\nr_o = sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(8) = 2 * sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can find the difference between r_i and r_o:\n\nr_i - r_o = 9 - 2 * sqrt(2)\n\nTo express this as a fraction, we can rationalize the denominator:\n\nr_i - r_o = (9 - 2 * sqrt(2)) * (1 \/ (1)) = (9 - 2 * sqrt(2)) \/ 1\n\nSince 9 and 2 * sqrt(2) are already relatively prime, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

The circumradius (R) is related to the sides of the triangle (a, b, c) and the area (A) through the formula:\n   R = abc \/ (4A)\n\n3. The distance from the incenter to the circumcenter is given by the formula:\n   I_O = a * b * c \/ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\n\nWe are given R = 13 and r = 6. We want to find AB * AC (let's denote this as x).\n\nNow, let's use the formula involving the inradius and the semiperimeter:\n   x \/ s = r\n\nFrom this, we can express the semiperimeter (s) as:\n   s = x \/ r\n\nNext, we use the formula involving the circumradius and the sides of the triangle:\n   R = x * (x \/ s) \/ (4A)\n\nSince we know R and r, we can relate them using the formula for the area (A) in terms of r and s:\n   A = r * s\n\nSubstituting this into the circumradius formula, we get:\n   13 = x * (x \/ (x \/ r)) \/ (4 * (r * (x \/ r)))\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n   13 = x^2 \/ (4r^2)\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of R and r into this equation:\n   13 = x^2 \/ (4 * 6^2)\n\nSolving for x^2, we get:\n   x^2 = 13 * 144 \/ 4\n   x^2 = 13 * 36\n   x^2 = 468\n\nFinally, we take the square root of both sides to find x:\n   x = sqrt(468)\n\nSimplifying the square root, we get:\n   x = sqrt(4 * 117)\n   x = 2 * sqrt(117)\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n<answer> 2 * sqrt(117) <\/answer>\n\nPlease note that this answer represents the product of the sides AB and AC (x), not their individual lengths. The numerical value of 2 * sqrt(117) is approximately 21.32.","inference_time":304.4864168167}

In base $b$, a two-digit number can be expressed as $ab_b = a \\cdot b^1 + b^0 = ab$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits in base $b$, they must be between 0 and $b-1$. So, the smallest two-digit number in base $b$ is $b$, and the largest is $b(b-1)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition for a number to be $b$-eautiful. A number $n$ is $b$-eautiful if it has two digits when expressed in base $b$ and the sum of these digits equals $\\sqrt{n}$.\n\nFor $n$ to have two digits in base $b$, we have $b \\leq n < b^2$.
