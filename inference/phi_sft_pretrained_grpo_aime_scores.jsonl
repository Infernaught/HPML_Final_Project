The torus is formed by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that is a distance 6 from the center. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the center of the circle inside the torus is at a distance of 6 (radius of the axis) + 3 (radius of the circle) = 9 from the center of the sphere.\n\nNow, consider a right triangle where one leg is the radius of the sphere (11), the other leg is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle inside the torus (9), and the hypotenuse is the radius of the sphere plus the radius of the circle inside the torus (r_i + 11). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n(r_i + 11)^2 = 11^2 + 9^2\n\nSolving for r_i:\n\nr_i^2 + 22r_i + 121 = 121 + 81\nr_i^2 + 22r_i = 81\nr_i^2 + 22r_i - 81 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for r_i:\n\n(r_i + 27)(r_i - 3) = 0\n\nSo, r_i = 3 or r_i = -27. Since the radius cannot be negative, r_i = 3.\n\nNext, we need to find the radius of the circle outside the torus (r_o). When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle outside the torus is 11 - 3 = 8.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem again, we have:\n\n(r_o + 11)^2 = 8^2 + 9^2\n\nSolving for r_o:\n\nr_o^2 + 22r_o + 121 = 64 + 81\nr_o^2 + 22r_o + 121 = 145\nr_o^2 + 22r_o - 24 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for r_o:\n\n(r_o + 24)(r_o - 1) = 0\n\nSo, r_o = 1 or r_o = -24. Since the radius cannot be negative, r_o = 1.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the radii:\n\nr_i - r_o = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nSince 2 is already in its simplest form with relatively prime positive integers, m = 2 and n = 1.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer> 2 + 1 = 3 <\/answer>.","inference_time":323.549986124}

The incenter (I) of a triangle is the intersection point of the angle bisectors.\n2. The circumcenter (O) of a triangle is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides.\n3. The circumradius (R) is the distance from the circumcenter to any vertex of the triangle.\n4. The inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle (incircle) that touches all three sides of the triangle.\n5. Euler's formula states that the distance between the circumcenter and incenter (OI) is given by OI = \u221a(R(R - 2r)), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius.\n\nGiven:\nCircumradius (R) = 13\nInradius (r) = 6\n\nWe need to find AB * AC, which is the product of the lengths of two sides of the triangle.\n\nLet's first find the distance between the circumcenter and incenter (OI) using Euler's formula:\nOI = \u221a(R(R - 2r))\nOI = \u221a(13(13 - 2*6))\nOI = \u221a(13(13 - 12))\nOI = \u221a(13*1)\nOI = \u221a13\n\nNow, let's consider the right triangle formed by the altitude from the incenter (I) to the circumcircle, the distance OI, and the radius of the incircle (r).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\nr^2 + OI^2 = (s\/2)^2, where s is the semiperimeter of the triangle.\n\n6^2 + (\u221a13)^2 = (s\/2)^2\n36 + 13 = (s\/2)^2\n49 = (s\/2)^2\ns\/2 = \u221a49\ns\/2 = 7\ns = 14\n\nThe semiperimeter (s) is half the perimeter, so the perimeter (P) is:\nP = 2s\nP = 2 * 14\nP = 28\n\nNow, let's express AB * AC in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let AB = x and AC = y. The perimeter P is given by:\nP = x + y + BC\n28 = x + y + BC\n\nWe know that the area (K) of the triangle can be expressed in two ways:\n1. Using Heron's formula: K = \u221a(s(s - x)(s - y)(s - BC))\n2. Using the inradius (r) and semiperimeter (s): K = rs\n\nSince both formulas represent the same area, we can set them equal to each other:\n\u221a(s(s - x)(s - y)(s - BC)) = rs\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\u221a(14(14 - x)(14 - y)(14 - (28 - x - y))) = 6 * (14 - x - y)\n\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the square root:\n(14(14 - x)(14 - y)(14 - (28 - x - y))) = (6 * (14 - x - y))^2\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve for x * y:\n14(14 - x)(14 - y)(x + y) = 36(14 - x - y)^2\n\nExpanding the terms:\n14(196 - 28x - 14y + 14xy) = 36(196 - 28x - 28y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2)\n\nDistributing and simplifying:\n2744 - 408x - 196y + 196xy = 6912 - 864x - 864y + 36x^2 + 72xy + 36y^2\n\nRearranging terms and combining like terms:\n36x^2 + 72xy - 408x - 864y + 864x + 864y - 36y^2 - 2744 + 196y - 196xy = 0\n\nSimplifying further:\n36x^2 + 456x - 36y^2 = 0\n\nNow, let's factor out a common factor of 36:\n36(x^2 + 12.67x - y^2) = 0\n\nSince x and y cannot be zero (they represent side lengths), we can divide both sides by 36:\nx^2 + 12.67x - y^2 = 0\n\nThis equation represents a relationship between x and y, but we need to find the product AB * AC = x * y. To do this, we can use the fact that the area of the triangle (K) can also be expressed as:\nK = (1\/2) * AB * AC\nK = (1\/2) * x * y\n\nWe know that K = rs, so:\n(1\/2) * x * y = rs\n(1\/2) * x * y = 6 * (14 - x - y)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for (1\/2) * x * y into our previous equation:\nx^2 + 12.67x - (rs) = 0\n\nSubstituting the value of rs:\nx^2 + 12.67x - (6 * (14 - x - y)) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\nx^2 + 12.67x - 84 + 6x + 6y = 0\nx^2 + 18.67x - 84 + 6y = 0\n\nNow, we need to find a way to solve for x * y. Unfortunately, this equation does not have a straightforward solution for x * y.

The slope of line segment AB is (y2 - y1) \/ (x2 - x1) = (\u221a3\/2 - 0) \/ (0 - 1\/2) = -\u221a3.\nNow, let's find the slope of OC. Since OC is perpendicular to AB, the product of their slopes is -1. So the slope of OC is 1\/\u221a3.\nNow, let's find the equation of line OC. Since it passes through O(0,0), we can use the slope-intercept form of a line: y = mx, where m is the slope.\nSo the equation of OC is y = (1\/\u221a3)x.\nNow, let's find the coordinates of C by substituting the equation of OC into the equation of AB.

The smallest integer greater than or equal to $b+1$ is $b+1$, and the largest integer less than or equal to $b^2 - 1$ is $b^2 - 1$.\n\nThe number of integers within this range is:\n$(b^2 - 1) - (b+1) + 1 = b^2 - b - 1$\n\nWe want this number to be greater than 10:\n$b^2 - b - 1 > 10$\n\nNow, let's solve this quadratic inequality for b:\n$b^2 - b - 11 > 0$\n\nTo find the roots of this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n$b = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-11)}}{2(1)}$\n$b = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{45}}{2}$\n\nWe have two roots, but since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, we only consider the positive root:\n$b = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{45}}{2}$\n\nSince $b$ must be an integer, we need to find the smallest integer greater than this value. The square root of 45 is approximately 6.7, so the value of b is approximately:\n$b \\approx \\frac{1 + 6.7}{2} \\approx 3.85$\n\nThe smallest integer greater than 3.85 is 4. Therefore, the least integer b greater than or equal to 2 for which there are more than ten $b$ -eautiful integers is:\n\n<answer> 4 <\/answer>\n\nHowever, we need to check if there are indeed more than ten $b$ -eautiful integers for b = 4.\n\nFor b = 4, the two-digit numbers are 5 to 15 (in base 10), and their sums are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. We can see that there are indeed more than ten $b$ -eautiful integers for b = 4:\n\n5 -> 9 (2^2)\n6 -> 12 (3^2)\n7 -> 16 (4^2)\n8 -> 20 (5^2)\n9 -> 25 (5^2)\n10 -> 36 (6^2)\n11 -> 49 (7^2)\n12 -> 64 (8^2)\n13 -> 81 (9^2)\n14 -> 100 (10^2)\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<answer> 4 <\/answer>\n\nThere are indeed more than ten $b$ -eautiful integers for b = 4.","inference_time":444.9105389118}

We have 12 sides in a dodecagon.<\/think>\n<think>Now, let's consider the rectangles. For a rectangle to be formed inside the dodecagon, it must have two sides on the dodecagon and two sides on the diagonals.

Pairs of diagonals that connect two vertices two places apart: There are 12 vertices, so we have 12 choices for the first vertex. For the second vertex, we have 10 choices (since it must be two places apart and cannot be the same vertex or adjacent to it). However, we have counted each rectangle twice (once for each diagonal), so we need to divide by 2. Thus, the number of rectangles for this type is (12 * 10) \/ 2 = 60.\n2. Pairs of diagonals that connect two vertices three places apart: Similarly, we have 12 choices for the first vertex and 9 choices for the second vertex (since it must be three places apart and cannot be the same vertex or adjacent to it).

Thus, the number of rectangles for this type is (12 * 9) \/ 2 = 54.\n<\/think>\n<think>Finally, we add the number of rectangles for each type to get the total number of rectangles: 60 + 54 = 114.<\/think>\n<answer>114<\/answer>\n\nFinal answer: 114.","inference_time":238.6682260036}
