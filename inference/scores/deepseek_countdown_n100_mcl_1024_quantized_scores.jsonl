This is because 66 - 33 = 33 and 33 + 80 = 113, which is not what we want.\n\nThe next thing that comes to mind is to use division. 66 divided by 33 equals 2 and then multiplying by 80 gives us 160. But this is not what we want either, since 160 is more than 78.\n\nThe next thing that comes to mind is to use multiplication. If we divide 66 by 33 (which equals 2) and then multiply by 80, we get 160. But that's not correct either.\n\nThe last thing that comes to mind is to use addition.
