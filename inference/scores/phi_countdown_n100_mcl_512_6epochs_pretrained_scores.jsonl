And return the final equation and answer in <answer> <\/answer> tags, for example <answer> (1 + 2) \/ 3 <\/answer>. Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nFirst, I need to find a combination of operations that will result in 75 using the numbers 2, 84, and 33.\n\nI can start by observing that 84 is close to 75, but if I subtract it from 75, I get a negative number. However, if I multiply 2 by 33, I get 66, and then I can subtract that from 84 to get the difference, which is 18.\n\nNow I have two numbers left: 2 and 18. I can multiply 2 by 18 to get 36, and then subtract that from 84 to get the desired result of 75.\n\nSo, the equation will be:\n\n84 - (2 * 33) + 2\n\nLet's calculate it:\n\n84 - (2 * 33) + 2\n= 84 - 66 + 2\n= 18 + 2\n= 20\n\nIt seems like I made a mistake because the result is 20, not 75. Let's try a different approach.\n\nIf I subtract 33 from 84, I get 51. Then, I can divide that by 2 to get 25.5, which is still not 75. But if I add 25.5 to 33, I get 58.5, which is not 75 either.\n\nIt seems like I made another mistake. I should try a different approach.\n\nLet's try combining the numbers differently:\n\n84 - (33 - 2) = 84 - 31 = 53\n\nNow I have 53 and 2 left. If I multiply 53 by 2, I get 106, which is too high.\n\nLet's try adding instead:\n\n84 + (33 \/ 2) = 84 + 16.5 = 100.5\n\nThis is also not the desired result.\n\nAfter trying various combinations, I found the correct equation:\n\n84 \/ (33 \/ 2) + 2 = 84 \/ 16.5 + 2 = 5.09 + 2 = 7.09\n\nThis is still not 75. I made another mistake. Let's try a different approach:\n\n84 - (33 \/ (2 + 2)) = 84 - (33 \/ 4) = 84 - 8.25 = 75.75\n\nThis is close, but not exactly 75. Let's try one more time:\n\n84 - (33 \/ 2) + 2 = 84 - 16.5 + 2 = 67.5 + 2 = 69.5\n\nI'm still not getting 75. I'm going to try another approach:\n\n(84 * 2) - 33 = 168 - 33 = 135\n\nThis is also not the desired result. Let's try a different approach:\n\n84 - (33 - 2) = 84 - 31 = 53\n\nNow, I can multiply 53 by 2 and add 2 to get the desired result:\n\n53 * 2 + 2 = 106 + 2 = 108\n\nThis is also not 75. I apologize for the confusion. Let's try another approach:\n\n84 - (33 \/ 2) + 2 = 84 - 16.5 + 2 = 67.5 + 2 = 69.5\n\nThis is still not 75. Let me try a different combination:\n\n84 - (33 \/ (2 + 2)) = 84 - (33 \/ 4) = 84 - 8.25 = 75.75\n\nThis is still not 75, but it's very close. I think I'm missing a factor to make it exactly 75. Let's try one more time:\n\n84 - (33 \/ 2) + (2 \/ 2) = 84 - 16.5 + 1 = 67.5 + 1 = 68.5\n\nI'm still not getting 75. I apologize for the repeated","inference_time":41.8716862202,"equation_score":0.0}

I notice that 14 and 44 are relatively close to each other, and when added together, they give 58. This is close to 54, and I can work with this.\n\nNext, I need to subtract or divide by a number that will bring 58 down to 54. I see that 13 could work since 58 - 13 = 45, and then I can divide by 71 to get close to 54. However, since I can't divide by a negative number and 71 is a positive number, I need to find another way to reach 54.\n\nI can try multiplying 13 by a fraction to get a smaller number.

We can try using subtraction since we have a number greater than 95 and need to get closer to it.\n\nFirst, let's subtract 76 from 96:\n96 - 76 = 20\n\nNow we have 20 and we need to subtract 5 more to get 95:\n20 - 76 is not possible since it will give us a negative number, which is not what we want.\n\nWe need to use both 76's in the equation. Let's try to subtract one 76 and find a way to use the other 76 to get the difference of 5.\n\nIf we take 76 and subtract it from the result of 96 - 76, we get:\n(96 - 76) - 76 = 20 - 76\n\nThis is not correct either, as it will give us a negative number.\n\nLet's try a different approach. We can subtract the smaller 76 from 96 and then divide the result by the larger 76 to get a fraction close to 1:\n(96 - 76) \/ 76 = 20 \/ 76\n\nNow we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4:\n(20 \/ 4) \/ (76 \/ 4) = 5 \/ 19\n\nThis fraction is close to 1 but not equal to 95. We need to find a way to get 95 using the two 76's.\n\nLet's multiply the fraction by 19 (to get the denominator to 19):\n(5 \/ 19) * 19 = 5\n\nNow we have 5, and we need to add 90 to get 95:\n5 + 90 = 95\n\nTo get 90, we can subtract one 76 from the other 76 and then multiply the result by 76:\n(76 - 76) * 76 = 0 * 76 = 0\n\nNow we need to add 90 to 0, and since 90 is not directly achievable with the numbers given, we need to divide 96 by a fraction of 1 (which is 1 itself):\n96 \/ (76 \/ 76) = 96 \/ 1 = 96\n\nNow we can subtract this 96 from the desired 95, but we need to adjust the equation to make it work:\n96 - (96 \/ (76 \/ 76)) = 96 - 96 = 0\n\nWe are still not getting 95. Let's try another approach:\n\n<think>\nWe can create a fraction first and then multiply it by a number to get closer to 95.\n\nLet's start with the fraction (76 \/ 76) which is equal to 1.
