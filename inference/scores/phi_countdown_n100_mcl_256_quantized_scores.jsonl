Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nTo find an equation that equals 86 using the numbers 54, 47, and 79, we can try different combinations of arithmetic operations. We can start by identifying that 79 is the closest to 86, so we should aim to add or subtract a smaller number to\/from it.\n\nWe can subtract 7 from 79 to get 72 (79 - 7 = 72). Now we need to find a way to combine 54 and 47 to get 72.\n\nWe can subtract 54 from 72 to get 18 (72 - 54 = 18). Now we need to combine 47 and 18 to get 86.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply 47 by 2 to get 94 (47 * 2 = 94) and then subtract 8 to get 86 (94 - 8 = 86).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n(79 - 7) - (54 - 47) * 2 - 8 = 86\n\nLet's check if this equation is correct:\n\n(79 - 7) - (54 - 47) * 2 - 8\n= 72 - 7 * 2 - 8\n= 72 - 14 - 8\n= 58 - 8\n= 50\n\nThis equation does not result in 86, so we need to try a different approach.\n\nLet's try using addition instead of subtraction for the first part:\n\n79 + 7 = 86\n\nNow we need to find a way to incorporate 54 and 47 without changing the sum. We can do this by adding 47 to 54 and then subtracting the result from 86:\n\n86 - (54 + 47) = 86 - 101 = -5\n\nThis equation also does not result in 86.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n79 + 47 - 54 = 126 - 54 = 72\n\nNow, we need to find a way to get from 72 to 86. We can add 14 to 72 to get 86:\n\n72 + 14 = 86\n\nWe can obtain 14 by multiplying 54 and 47 and then dividing by 4:\n\n(54 * 47) \/ 4 = 2538 \/ 4 = 634.5\n\nThis approach does not give us an integer value, so it's not suitable.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n(79 + 47) - (54 - 7) = 126 - 47 = 79\n\nThis equation also does not result in 86.\n\nAfter several attempts, it seems challenging to create an equation that equals 86 using these numbers with the given restrictions.

If I divide 69 by 24 and then add 5, I get:<\/think>\n\n<think>69 \/ 24 + 5 = 2.875 + 5 = 7.875, which is not 58 either.\n\n<think>Finally, I will try combining all the numbers using parentheses to get the correct result.

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nFirst, we need to find a combination of these numbers using basic arithmetic operations that gives us 19.\n\nWe can start by looking for operations that can help us get closer to 19. We notice that 32 is the largest number and subtracting 11 from it gives us 21. This is close to 19, but we need to reduce it further.\n\nNext, we can subtract 30 from 21, which gives us -9. Now, we need to add something to -9 to get 19.\n\nWe can add 31 to -9 to get 22, which is too high. However, if we subtract 31 from 32 first, we get 1. Then we can add 11 to 1 to get 12, and finally add 9 to 12 to get 21.\n\nNow we need to adjust the equation to get exactly 19. We can do this by replacing the subtraction of 31 with the division of 32 by 31, which gives us a fraction slightly less than 1. Adding 11 to this fraction and subtracting 30 should give us 19.\n\nSo the equation is: (32 \/ 31) + 11 - 30 = 19\n\nLet's check the result:\n\n(32 \/ 31) \u2248 1.03226\n1.03226 + 11 = 12.03226\n12.03226 - 30 = -17.96774\n\nThis is not correct. We need to adjust the equation further. Let's try another approach:\n\nWe can use multiplication and division to get close to 19. If we multiply 31 by 11, we get 341. Now we need to divide 341 by a number close to 32 to reduce it to 19.\n\n341 \/ (32 \/ 1) = 341 * (1 \/ 32) = 10.65625\n\nNow we need to add 30 to this result to get 19.\n\n10.65625 + 30 = 40.65625\n\nThis is also not correct. Let's try another approach:\n\nWe can multiply 30 by 31, which gives us 930. Now we need to divide this by a number that, when added to 32, gives us 19.\n\n930 \/ (32 + x) = 19\n\nLet's solve for x:\n\n930 = 19 * (32 + x)\n930 = 608 + 19x\n930 - 608 = 19x\n322 = 19x\nx = 322 \/ 19\nx \u2248 16.94737\n\nSince x is not an integer and we cannot use decimal values, this approach also doesn't work.

The difference between 61 and 54 is 7, which is half of 22. So, I can use subtraction and division to get 7 from 22.\n\nHere's the equation:\n\n(22 \/ 2) + 32 = 61\n\nNow let's check the calculation:\n\n(22 \/ 2) = 11\n11 + 32 = 43\n\nThis doesn't give us the desired result of 61.

So, I can add the product of 22 and 46 to it:\n\n(22 * 46) + (53 \/ 1) = 1012 + 53 = 1065\n\nThis is still too high.

However, if we subtract 10 from 58, we get:\n\n58 - 10 = 48\n\nNow we have 48 and 40 left. We can add 40 to 48 to get:\n\n48 + 40 = 88\n\n88 is still too large, so we need to find a way to reduce it to 62. We can subtract 26 from 88 to get:\n\n88 - 26 = 62\n\nNow we need to figure out how to get 26 from the remaining numbers 40 and 10.

Let's look at the numbers and operations again:\n\n58 - 10 = 48\n40 - 10 = 30\n\nWe need to find a way to combine these two results to get 62.\n\nIf we add 62 to 48, we get:\n\n48 + 62 = 110\n\nThis is too large. However, if we subtract 10 from 62, we get:\n\n62 - 10 = 52\n\nNow we have:\n\n48 + 52 = 100\n\nThis is still too large. We need to find a way to get exactly 62.\n\nLet's try multiplying 48 by a fraction to get closer to 62:\n\n48 * (52 \/ 48) = 48 * (13 \/ 12) = 52\n\nThis is still not 62.

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nTo create an equation that equals 41 using the numbers [9, 45, 22, 55], I will look for ways to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations.\n\nOne possible way is to start by finding a difference that's close to 41. The closest number to 41 is 45, and if we subtract 4 from it, we get 41. So, I can use 45 - 4. However, I don't have a 4 in the given numbers, so I need to find another way to get 4 using the given numbers.\n\nI can achieve this by subtracting 22 from 25, which gives me 3. Now I can add 1 to this result to get 4. So, I can use 22 - 22 + 1.\n\nNow, I have 45 - (22 - 22 + 1) = 45 - 1 = 44. I need to find a way to subtract a number from 44 to get 41. I can see that subtracting 3 from 44 gives me 41. To get 3, I can subtract 2 from 5.\n\nPutting it all together, I have:\n\n45 - ((22 - 22 + 1) - 2)\n\nLet's simplify this equation:\n\n45 - (1 - 2)\n\n45 - (-1)\n\n45 + 1\n\n46\n\nIt seems like I made a mistake in my calculation. The final result should be 41, not 46. I need to rethink my approach.\n\nAnother possible way is to use division. I can divide 55 by 11, which gives me 5. Then I can multiply this result by 8 to get 40. Adding 1 to this result will give me 41. Now I need to find a way to get 8 from the given numbers.\n\nI can achieve this by dividing 45 by 5.5 (which is 11\/2). Now I have:\n\n(55 \/ (45 \/ (11\/2))) + 1\n\nLet's simplify this equation:\n\n(55 \/ (9\/2)) + 1\n\n(55 * 2\/9) + 1\n\n(110\/9) + 1\n\n(110\/9) + (9\/9)\n\n129\/9\n\nDividing 129 by 9 gives me 14.333, which is still not 41.\n\nI seem to have made a mistake again. Let me try a different approach.\n\nI can use multiplication and subtraction to get closer to 41. If I multiply 9 by 5, I get 45. Then I can subtract 4 to get 41. To get 5, I can divide 22 by 4.4 (which is 11\/2.5).\n\nNow I have:\n\n(9 * (22 \/ (11\/2.5))) - 4\n\nLet's simplify this equation:\n\n(9 * (22 * 2.5\/11)) - 4\n\n(9 * (50\/11)) - 4\n\n(450\/11) - 4\n\n(450\/11) - (44\/11)\n\n(406\/11)\n\nDividing 406 by 11 gives me 37.

But I have to incorporate the other two numbers (76 and 76) in the equation without repeating them.\n\nIf I subtract one from 96, I could write it as 96 - 1. But I need to involve the other two numbers as well.\n\nSince both numbers are 76, I can add them together and then subtract that sum from 95. That would look like 95 - (76 + 76).
