Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nFirst, let's consider the numbers and their potential relationships. We need to reach 58 using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.\n\nOne approach is to find a combination where multiplication or division can help us get close to 58, and then use addition or subtraction to adjust the result.\n\nI notice that 40 is close to 58, and if I multiply it by 1.45 (approximately), I get close to 58:\n40 * 1.45 \u2248 58\n\nNow, let's find a way to incorporate the other numbers to get the multiplier of 1.45.\n\nWe can divide 69 by 24 to get a value close to 2.875:\n69 \/ 24 \u2248 2.875\n\nNow, let's multiply this result by 40:\n40 * (69 \/ 24) \u2248 40 * 2.875 \u2248 115\n\nNow we have reached a number much higher than 58.

Let's try dividing 57 by 24 and adjust with addition or subtraction:\n\n57 \/ 24 \u2248 2.375\n\nNow, let's multiply this result by 40 and adjust it:\n\n40 * (57 \/ 24) = 40 * 2.375 = 95\n\nNow we have a number close to 58.

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>\nFirst, let's try to find a combination of operations that will give us 14 using these numbers:\n\n1. We can start by looking for a pair of numbers that when combined with an arithmetic operation will give us a number close to 14.\n2. Among the given numbers, 18 and 44 are the highest, and if we subtract 14 from 44, we get 30, which is too high for our target.\n3. Instead, let's try subtracting 14 from 44 and then dividing the result by 2: (44 - 14) \/ 2 = 30 \/ 2 = 15\n4. Now we are close to 14, but we need to reduce it by 1. We can achieve this by subtracting 1 from the result.\n5. We have 18 and 35 left. If we subtract 3 from 18, we get 15, which is one more than our current result of 15.\n6. Now we can use the 3 and the 15 we got from the previous step to adjust our result: (15 - (3 \/ 18)) = 15 - (1\/6)\n7. To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply 15 by 6\/6 and then subtract 1\/6: (15 * 6\/6) - 1\/6 = (90\/6) - 1\/6 = 89\/6\n8. Finally, we can divide 89\/6 by 44 to get closer to 14: (89\/6) \/ 44 = 89 \/ (6 * 44) = 89 \/ 264\n9. To simplify the fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by 11: 89 \/ 264 = 8.09 \/ 24\n10. Now we are almost at 14, we just need to adjust the decimal part by adding 5.91 (approximately) to the result: 8.09 + 5.91 = 14\n\nConsidering we cannot use decimals or approximate values, we need to find a different approach using only integers and the given operations.\n\nLet's try this:\n\n(18 \/ 1) - (35 \/ 44) = 18 - 0.795 = 17.205\n\n17.205 is not exactly 14. Let's try another combination:\n\n(18 - (44 \/ 44)) \/ 35 = (18 - 1) \/ 35 = 17 \/ 35 = 0.4857\n\nAgain, this is not 14. We need to find the correct combination.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, here's one that works:\n\n(18 \/ (44 \/ (35 - 14))) = 18 \/ (44 \/ 21) = 18 \/ (2.0952) \u2248 8.57\n\nThis is still not 14. Let's try one more combination:\n\n(18 * (35 \/ (44 - 14))) = 18 * (35 \/ 30) = 18 * (7\/6) = 21\n\nThis is also not 14. It seems challenging to get exactly 14 with these numbers and operations. Let's re-examine our approach and try a different combination:\n\n(18 \/ 1) - (44 \/ (35 - 14)) = 18 - (44 \/ 21) = 18 - 2.0952 \u2248 15.9048\n\nThis is still not 14. It appears there might be a mistake in the approach, or it might not be possible to achieve exactly 14 with the given numbers and operations.\n\nAfter carefully re-evaluating, here's a possible solution:\n\n(18 \/ (14 + 1)) + 35 - 44 = (18 \/ 15) + 35 - 44 = 1.2 + 35 - 44 = 36.2 - 44 = -7.8\n\nThis is also not correct.

Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>First, I will consider the numbers and the target sum, 62. Since 58 is the largest number, I think of using it as a starting point. I will try to reach 62 by adding or subtracting a combination of the other two numbers, 40 and 10.\n\nOne possible approach is to first subtract 10 from 58, which will get me closer to 62:\n58 - 10 = 48<\/think>\n\nNow I have a number, 48, and I need to reach 62. The difference between 48 and 62 is 14. I can use the remaining number, 40, to get closer to this difference. I can subtract 40 from 48 and then add the result to 40:\n\n48 - 40 = 8\n8 + 40 = 48<\/think>\n\nNow, I need to get from 48 to 62. I can add 14 to 48:\n\n48 + 14 = 62<\/think>\n\nTo achieve this, I can divide 40 by a fraction that will give me 14. The fraction could be 40\/2.5 (since 40\/2.5 = 16, and 16 - 2 = 14). However, the equation should only use basic arithmetic operations and parentheses, and division by a non-integer is not allowed.\n\nSo, I will reconsider the approach and try to get 14 from the remaining numbers, 40 and 10, using multiplication:\n\n40 * (1\/4) = 10\n10 + 10 = 20<\/think>\n\nNow, I need to subtract this 20 from 58 to get closer to 62:\n\n58 - 20 = 38<\/think>\n\nFinally, I can add the difference between 38 and 62, which is 24, to 38:\n\n38 + 24 = 62<\/think>\n\nTo get 24, I can multiply 10 by 2.4 (since 10 * 2.4 = 24). However, as mentioned before, we can't use decimal numbers in division.\n\nLet's try a different approach. If I subtract 40 from 58, I'll get 18. Then I can use the 10 to turn this 18 into 28:\n\n58 - 40 = 18\n18 + 10 = 28<\/think>\n\nNow I need to turn this 28 into 62. I can do this by dividing 28 by a fraction that will give me 34 (since 28 + 34 = 62). The fraction could be 28\/34, which simplifies to 14\/17. However, this still involves fractions.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\nIf I subtract 10 from 58, I'll get 48. Then I can multiply this by a fraction that will give me 14 (since 48 * (14\/48) = 14). The fraction simplifies to 7\/24. But again, this involves fractions.\n\nI'll try another approach:\n\nIf I subtract 10 from 58, I'll get 48. Then I can subtract 40 from this 48, which will give me -2. Now, I need to turn this -2 into 62. I can do this by adding 64 (since -2 + 64 = 62). I can get 64 by multiplying 10 by 6.4, but again, we can't use decimal numbers.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\nIf I subtract 10 from 58, I'll get 48.

We need to find another approach.\n\nLet's try this:\n\n(96 - 76) \/ (76 \/ 76) = 95\n\nNow let's verify the final equation:\n\n<think>\n76 \/ 76 = 1\n96 - 76 = 20\n20 \/ 1 = 20\n\nThis equation doesn't give us the desired result either. We need to find another approach.\n\nAfter trying different approaches, I realize that it's not possible to create an equation using the numbers 96, 76, and 76 with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, \/) and parentheses that equals 95, as we cannot eliminate the 20 obtained from 96 - 76 and reach exactly 95 with the given numbers.\n\n<answer> (96 - (76 \/ 76)) - 1 <\/answer>\n\nHowever, please note that this equation does not equal 95, as shown in the verification steps above. It's not possible to achieve the desired result with the given constraints.","inference_time":40.8806962967,"equation_score":0.0}
